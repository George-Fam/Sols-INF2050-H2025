Solution for plants and flies.

## Learning goals

 * Interfaces recap, interface notation recap
 * Interface hierarchies
 * Code smells
 * Javadoc

## Contents

 * Interfaces recap, interface notation
	* Download prepared plant and potatoe class
        * Run photosynthesis and drinkWater code
 * Interface hierarchies
        * Study interface extension sketch
	* Add new interface canrivorousplant
        * Extend plant interface
        * Add a sample carnivorous plant
* Not just one class per interface exercise
	* Add Fly interface
	* Add two fly classes
        * Change carnivoureplant interface to eat fly object
	* Have carnivoureplant print fly type, change from if statement to check type to polymorphism
* Javadoc
        * explanation of javadoc syntax
	* create javadoc for code
        * open and inspect index.html
        * improve code until there are no more warnings, use param and returns, create default constructors
* Bonus code smells
        * In class we've seen a series of code smells
        * Inject as many as you can into provided code snippet, but ensure the code is still working (list example from class)
